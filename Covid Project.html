									<p>This project conducts a comprehensive analysis of COVID-19 data to extract meaningful insights regarding <u>infection rates</u>, <u>death rates</u>, and vaccination progress across various locations and timeframes.
										The <b>SQL</b> queries and views are designed to evaluate several key metrics. The project begins with analyzing the likelihood of death after contracting COVID-19 in specific locations, exemplified by Greece, by calculating the <u>deaths per 100 cases</u>.
										It further examines the percentage of the population infected by comparing <u>total cases</u> to population sizes. Additionally, the project ranks countries by their highest <u>infection ratios</u> and <u>death counts</u> in relation to their populations, providing a global perspective on the pandemic's impact. 
										The analysis also includes the creation of <u>rolling sums</u> and <u>death rates</u> on a global scale, allowing for a dynamic understanding of the situation as it evolves.
									</p>
									<p>Moreover, the project emphasizes the relationship between population size and vaccination efforts. 
										By utilizing <b>common table expressions (CTEs)</b> and <b>temporary tables</b>, it calculates <u>rolling sums</u> of vaccinations to track progress over time. 
										This is complemented by creating <b>views for visualizations</b>, which streamline the representation of the data for better interpretation and decision-making. 
										Specifically, views like PercentPopulationVaccinated, GlobalCovidCasualties, ContinentCovidCasualties, and DeathPerPopulation facilitate ongoing analysis and reporting. 
										These views aggregate data at different levels, such as global, continental, and country-specific, providing a multi-faceted approach to understanding the pandemic's trends and informing public health strategies.
