										<h2>Brief Description</h2>
									</header>
									<p>In this mock project, Bellabeat is seeking marketing insights and suggestions for their jewellery fitness tracking products.
										A Fitbit dataset on their fitness trackers was available to gain potential insights.
									<br>Data was imported into Microsoft SQL Server using a custom Visual Studio script. Subsequently, data relevant to the company's products was processed and analysed. 
										The conclucsions and suggestions on which tracking features are worth the investment and which are not were summarised in a powerpoint presentation utilising the appropriate data visualisations. 
										Finally, the following plan of action was layed out to transform the insights into actionable steps.

												<h3>Ask & Preparation Phase</h3>
											</header>
											<p>The project's task was to Focus on one of the Bellabeat products and help guide the marketing stratergy of the product. 
												First, a comprehensive scope of work was developed to define the project's initial objectives, major activities, and to clearly delineate its boundaries. 
												This document also detailed the project deliverables and established deadlines for each step.
											</p>
											<p>To achieve this, insights were gained from analyzing consumer usage of non-Bellabeat devices. 
												The data was swiftly reviewed to determine the next steps. Importing the data manually proved to be more time-consuming than desired, leading to the decision to develop a dynamic import system, which would also benefit future projects. 
												As the available data was not first-party, extra care was taken to ensure that analysis time was efficiently spent on relevant data only.

												<h3>Import & Processing</h3>
											</header>
											<p> A custom C# script was utilised in Visual Studio to dynamically import data into Microsoft SQL Server, 
												addressing the challenge of time-consuming and error-prone manual data entry.
												This approach was necessary due to the complexity and volume of data, which included 26 substantial medium-sized tables, each with up to 59 columns and 940 rows. 
												To ensure reproducibility for future projects, a detailed debugging report was also submitted. 
											</p>
											<p> Once the data was successfully imported, 
												the column data types were optimized to significantly enhance query performance. Subsequently, rigorous data validation was conducted within SQL Server,
												including checks for NULL, missing, and duplicate values, ensuring the integrity of the data before advancing to the analysis phase.

												<h3>Analysis</h3>
											</header>
											<p>Microsoft SQL Server was utilized to convert and validate multi-granular datasets—daily, hourly and minute-level data—to ensure consistency and accuracy, 
												highlighting a deep understanding of data structure and integrity. Techniques such as Common Table Expressions (CTEs), PERCENT_RANK and JOINS
												were leveraged. 
											</p>
											<p>Futhermore, techniques were employed in combination to enable more advanced filtering in order to conduct comprehensive analyses,
												identifying patterns in user behavior, tracking feature usage consistency,
												and exploring relationships between different metrics, such as sleep patterns and calorie output.
											</p> 
											<p>Data nuances were independently uncovered, and meaningful insights were drawn,
												,ensuring data quality, and delivering actionable insights—skills that are crucial for any data-driven decision-making process.</p>

												<h3>Sharing Insights</h3>
											</header>
											<p>	In the final phase of this project, the focus was placed on effectively communicating data-driven insights to stakeholders 
												through clear and impactful visualizations, tailored presentations, and strategic recommendations.
											</p>
											<p> Complex data was translated into actionable insights, ensuring that the key findings could be easily grasped 
												by both technical and non-technical audiences. Data-backed recommendations were provided,
												with product features prioritized based on user engagement, and the importance of ongoing user feedback was emphasized 
												to refine the product and adapt marketing strategies.
											</p>
											<p>	All findings and methodologies were thoroughly documented 
												to support transparency and future reference
